# Seattle Collisions Project 

## Goals of the Project:

1. Clean and prepare Seattle area collision data for regression and other machine learning projects. 
2. Integrate with crime data. This will be used to determine the crime rate in each neighborhood that a collision occurs. 
3. Create a visualization of Seattle area collision data. 
4. Advanced analysis of Seattle area collision data. 

## Use Cases:

- For each use case, we plan to create on jypter notebook demo. 
- The demo will call the components which will by python method(s) that are within our vehicle_collisions/

### Where do more accidents occur in Seattle? Where should I avoid driving or living?

Add description - to each

### How does weather/climate effect driving?

Assign: Fei

### Do different types of accidents happen in different neighborhoods with different levels of crime (911 call)?

Assign: Libby 

### Have the number of accidents changed over time? Can we see the change in Seattle speed limits in the Seattle collision data?

Assign: Geoff 

## Components:

- The components are in the order that we will work through them.
